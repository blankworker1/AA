# 21 Rules

Rule 1 — AA Ltd Share Model

Each share in AA Ltd functions as both a legal instrument and a collectible certificate artwork. Shares are issued in three classes:

1. A4 — Original Edition: Active 4-year edition, full voting/participation rights.


2. C4 — Renewal Edition: Issued every 4 years if shareholder opts in; retains voting/participation.


3. R4 — Residual Edition: Automatically issued if no renewal; preserves ownership record, no voting rights.



Maximum issuance: 21 new certificates per 4-year cycle, ensuring predictable scarcity and traceable provenance.

Rule 2 — Single Share Class per Cycle

Each 4-year cycle has one class of active shares (A4 or C4). R4 shares are archival only.

All active shareholders have equal voting rights; R4 holders retain historical ownership but no votes.

Rule 4 — No Call Option

No calls can be issued on partly-paid shares under any circumstances.

Rule 5 — Director

One director oversees corporate, legal, and operational duties; maintains minimal exposure.

Rule 6 — NEDs
