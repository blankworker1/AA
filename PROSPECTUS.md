## PAGE 2 — NOTICE TO THE READER

This document is not an invitation to the public.

It is a private communication issued to a limited number of sovereign individuals. It describes an artistic, legal, and economic experiment operating within the framework of UK company law.

Ownership is optional. Understanding is essential.


---

## PAGE 3 — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Anonymous Art Ltd (“AA”) is a company formed to create, hold, and distribute verifiably scarce digital–physical artworks.

The company issues 21 ordinary shares, each represented by a limited-edition physical share certificate. These certificates are artworks, legal instruments, and collectible assets.

This Prospectus outlines the structure, philosophy, and mechanics of the offering.


---

## PAGE 4 — WHY ANONYMOUS ART

Anonymous Art exists because authorship has become noise.

AA removes personality, reputation, and biography from the centre of value creation. What remains is structure, signal, and resonance.

The work stands alone.
The system remembers.


---

## PAGE 5 — THE AA BLUEPRINT

AA operates on a closed cycle:

Creation → Product → Gallery → Payment → Delivery → Storage

Each stage is permissionless, digital-first, and irreversible.
Once released, artworks persist independently of the artist.


---

## PAGE 6 — ART AS ASSET

AA treats art explicitly as an asset class.

Art, Bitcoin, shares, and digital objects are not metaphors — they are instruments. Value is not assigned; it is revealed through interaction.

Pure art = pure commodity.


---

## PAGE 7 — THE WORKS

Initial works include:

BALANCE — a hybrid digital dashboard artwork

Open Secret — participatory, tip-driven digital art

Gold — limited-edition physical bars with embedded cryptographic identity


Each work is finite, numbered, and permanently recorded.


---

## PAGE 8 — BALANCE

BALANCE is a live artwork that visualises value, attention, and contribution in real time.

It operates continuously, beyond exhibitions, and persists as a public ledger of interaction.

BALANCE cannot be owned outright — only participated in.


---

## PAGE 9 — OPEN SECRET

Open Secret uses tipping as signal.

No pricing.
No buy button.
Only response.

The artwork records what viewers choose to reveal through action.


---

## PAGE 10 — FOOLS GOLD

FOOLS GOLD consists of 21 limited-edition physical bars.

They resemble commodities but are deliberately false.

They contain no gold.

Each bar embeds an NFC identity, cryptographic serialisation, and certificate of authenticity.

FOOLS GOLD is performance, object, and critique.


---
