# Shareholders 


Shareholders — also known as The Chosen

## Position within AA

Shareholders are the legal owners of Anonymous Art Ltd.

The company has 21 shareholders, each holding one ordinary share.

Together, they form the ownership layer of AA.


---

## Core Responsibilities

Shareholders have no operational duties.

They are not involved in day-to-day management, production, or administration of artworks. Their responsibility is custodial rather than executive.


---

## Role within the Artwork

Each share is both:

a legally recognised equity interest in AA Ltd

a limited-edition physical certificate artwork


The share certificate forms part of the AA body of work. Ownership of the share constitutes participation in the artwork at a structural level.


---

## Governance & Power

Shareholders collectively hold ultimate authority over AA Ltd, including:

appointment and removal of the Director

approval of changes to the Articles of Association

approval of future share issuance, subject to supermajority thresholds


Voting rights apply only to active editions of shares, as defined in the share model.


---

## Visibility & Anonymity

Shareholders are not required to be public.

They may remain anonymous or identified, at their discretion. There is no expectation to promote, represent, or explain AA or its works.


---

## Term & Commitment

Share ownership is open-ended.

Shares persist beyond exhibitions, events, or production cycles. Renewal, archival, or residual status is governed by the edition model defined in the Articles.


---

## Ideal Shareholder Profile

An ideal shareholder:

understands legal ownership

values scarcity and permanence

recognises art as a structural asset

is comfortable holding without performance


No background in art, finance, or technology is required.


---

## Function in the System

Shareholders provide stability, legitimacy, and continuity.

They do not operate the system.
They enable it to exist.

AA functions because ownership is defined, finite, and held.

old version:

Every UK limited company requires one or more shareholders. AA Ltd has 21 shareholders.

The shareholders, known as the Chosen, are sovereign individuals who understand what it means to decide.

They recognise that freedom is not granted, but exercised. Each has understood the vision and aims of Anonymous Art and has made a conscious choice to participate.

They are collectors of assets.

Art is an asset.

Bitcoin is an asset.

Shares are an asset.

A limited-edition physical share certificate, legally recognised, partly paid in Bitcoin, is an apex asset that combines:

ownership

scarcity

legal force

belief


To hold one is not to speculate, but to belong.

Ownership functions like a passport - quiet proof of participation in a system that operates on different rails.

The Chosen do not seek attention. They do not perform. They hold.

### NEXT STEPS 

Distil this into a short inscription for the back of the share certificates

## Who are the Chosen?

The chosen are not chosen, they choose for themselves

We should approach profiling for an artwork, not as marketing or financial solicitation. The prospectus is itself a conceptual object. Who receives it is part of the work.

Here is a clear, grounded profile of who the Chosen are, and just as importantly, who they are not.


## Who the Prospectus Is For

1. Sovereign Collectors

These are people who already think in terms of ownership, custody, and self-direction.

Comfortable holding assets directly

Understand the difference between possession and control

Not dependent on institutions to validate value


They don’t ask “Is this allowed?”
They ask “Does this make sense?”



2. Asset-Literate, Not Speculative

The Chosen are not chasing upside.

They understand:

Art as an asset class

Bitcoin as an asset, not a trade

Shares as instruments of governance, not leverage


They are comfortable with:

Illiquidity

Long time horizons

Assets that cannot be easily priced


If they ask “What’s the exit plan?” — they are not Chosen.


3. Culturally Bilingual

They can move between worlds without explanation:

Art ↔ finance

Law ↔ culture

Physical ↔ digital


They understand that:

A legal document can be an artwork

A company can be a sculpture

A share certificate can be more meaningful than a token


They don’t need metaphors explained.


4. Low-Signal, High-Agency Individuals

The Chosen are rarely loud.

Not obsessed with public profiles

Not building personal brands

Comfortable operating privately


They recognise that true power does not announce itself.


5. Already Inside the System — or Already Outside It

Two acceptable archetypes:

A. Inside, but disillusioned

Senior figures in art, finance, law, or technology

Understand the system’s limits from within


B. Outside, by design

Independent thinkers

Builders, collectors, or patrons who opted out early


Both understand that new structures must be built, not protested.


---

## Who the Prospectus Is NOT For

Retail investors

Speculators

Influencers

Grant-seekers

People asking for permission

People who need reassurance


If they need convincing, they are not Chosen.


---

## How the Physical Prospectus Is Sent

Direct, private delivery

No public application

No pitch deck

No deadline pressure


Receiving the prospectus is not an offer.
It is an invitation to decide.

Silence is a valid response.
Declining is respected.

Choosing is the act.


---

## Final Framing

The prospectus is not about selling shares.

It is about identifying:

> people who already live as if this structure should exist.


Those who recognise it will recognise themselves.
