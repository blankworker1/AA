Anonymous Art IPO Launch Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Concept & Planning

1. Define overall AA IPO concept and philosophy.


2. Finalize funnel structure: QR code → Prospectus S → LN signal → Prospectus L → Invitation to Participate → LN payment → Physical artifacts.


3. Establish edition size: 21 physical shares / Prospectus + COAs.


4. Decide pricing structure: £1 statutory + £1,000 artifact contribution → total £1,001 per share.


5. Draft legal and corporate structure: AA Ltd, Articles, shareholder rights, single director, stacked provenance framework.


6. Determine artistic and design specs: physical Prospectus, COA, Share Certificate, NFC tag embedding.

## Phase 2 — Digital Asset Preparation

1. Create Prospectus S (short version) — teaser PDF, first few pages.


2. Create Prospectus L (full version) — 21-page full digital document.


3. Draft Invitation to Participate PDF including LN invoice QR and live share availability field.


4. Upload all digital versions to IPFS (Prospectus S, Prospectus L, Invitation to Participate).


5. Prepare unique identifiers for stacked provenance (edition numbers, NFC tag IDs).

## Phase 3 — Physical Artifact Production

1. Print 21 physical Prospectuses, spiral-bound, numbered 1–21.


2. Produce 21 Certificates of Authenticity (COA) with stacked provenance numbering and NFC tag integration.


3. Produce 21 Share Certificates, numbered and corresponding to edition.


4. Embed NFC tags linking to IPFS-hosted digital COA.


5. Assemble package for each shareholder: Prospectus, COA, Share Certificate, protective envelope/packaging.

## Phase 4 — Funnel & Website Setup

1. Generate QR code linking to Prospectus S.


2. Prepare instructional content in Prospectus S and L for sending initial LN signals.


3. Set up AA IPO dashboard page with 21 numbered boxes representing shares; include manual update system for live availability.


4. Prepare visual instructions for digital funnel usage, if needed for gallery display.

## Phase 5 — Launch & Distribution

1. Release Prospectus S publicly via QR code.


2. Collect LN signals from participants requesting Prospectus L.


3. Deliver Prospectus L to those who signaled interest.


4. After Prospectus L delivery, send Invitation to Participate PDF with LN invoice QR for physical artifacts.


5. Confirm LN payments for full share participation.


6. Deliver physical packages (Prospectus + COA + Share Certificate) to the 21 shareholders.

## Phase 6 — Post-Launch

1. Update AA IPO dashboard daily to reflect claimed shares.


2. Track stacked provenance: LN signals → digital Prospectus → physical artifacts → COA → NFC verification.


3. Maintain IPFS records of all digital assets for permanence.


4. Optional: announce completion of 21-share sellout to art community (minimalistic, ritual tone).


5. Document process as part of AA history / internal archive.

## Notes / Considerations

No automation required for LN invoice or dashboard updates.

Maintain artful, institutional tone throughout all communications.

Everything produced (Prospectus, COA, Share Certificate) is an artwork in itself.

Stacked provenance ensures both digital and physical layers are verifiable and permanent
