# AA Letter of Endorsement 

## 1. Nature and Purpose 

A Letter of Endorsement is a document issued by the Company for evidentiary and record-keeping purposes only, confirming the conversion of a Share from one class to another and the retirement and legal inertness of the physical certificate formerly evidencing that Share. 

It does not constitute, create, transfer, or evidence any legal, equitable, voting, or economic interest in the Company, and shall not be relied upon as proof of current share ownership, which shall be determined exclusively by entries in the register of members maintained in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.


## 2. Conversion and Certificate Retirement


Upon the conversion of a Share from one class to another (including, without limitation, A4 → C4 or C4 → R4), the Shareholding shall be converted in accordance with the Articles and recorded in the register of members.

Upon such conversion, the original physical share certificate shall be deemed retired and legally inert, and shall cease to evidence any legal, voting, or economic rights in the Company.

The physical certificate shall not be required to be returned to the Company.


## 3. Letter of Endorsement


Following conversion, the Company shall issue a Letter of Endorsement confirming:
(a) the conversion of the Share,
(b) the retirement and legal inertness of the original physical certificate, and
(c) the continuation of the Shareholding in the new Share class.

The Letter of Endorsement shall be digitally recorded and published to a decentralized content-addressed storage system (including IPFS) in the same manner as a Certificate of Authenticity (COA).

A reference or access link to the Letter of Endorsement shall be communicated to the Shareholder by electronic means, including via a Lightning transaction message or equivalent cryptographically verifiable notification.


## 4. Secondary Value 


Upon issuance of the Letter of Endorsement, the retired physical certificate may be sold, auctioned, or otherwise transferred as a collectible limited edition.

Any value realized from such sale or transfer shall constitute the Shareholder’s Return on Investment (ROI), determined solely by market demand and reflecting scarcity, provenance, edition number, historical lineage, and cultural significance, rather than any rights formerly attached to the underlying Share.


## 5. Calculation and Recognition


The Company shall not fix, guarantee, or underwrite ROI, which is inherently market-determined and independent of the Company’s financial performance or distributions.

Any realization of value from a retired certificate shall be separate from and shall not affect the rights, obligations, or status of the Shareholder in respect of the converted Share.


## 6. Scope


This definition applies to all Share classes (including A4, C4, and R4) and any successor or additional classes created pursuant to the Articles.
