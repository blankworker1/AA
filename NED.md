# Non-Executive Director (NED) - AA Ltd


## Position within AA

Non-Executive Directors form the Privy Council of AA Ltd.
They do not manage the company. They witness, advise, and challenge.
Their authority is collective, not individual.

Each NED is appointed for their domain knowledge, but operates within a shared conceptual frame.

---
## Core Responsibilities

Provide independent oversight to the Director.

Advise on matters of risk, integrity, and long-term intent.

Represent a specific area of expertise (e.g. law, digital art, cryptography, finance, culture, systems).

Ensure that decisions remain aligned with the AA ethos, not short-term utility.

---
## Role within the Artwork

NEDs are not employees; they are participants.

Their presence is part of the structure of the work itself.

Each NED acts as a living constraint, preventing collapse into commerce, spectacle, or excess.


They do not produce artworks.
They protect the conditions under which artworks exist.


---
## Governance & Power

NEDs hold no executive power.

They cannot issue shares, call capital, or override the Director individually.

As a group, they may:

Request explanations

Record dissent

Trigger formal review

Their influence is procedural, not performative.


---
## Visibility & Anonymity

NEDs may remain anonymous or pseudonymous, by choice.

Public recognition is not required; contribution outweighs attribution.

Their role is to stabilize the system, not to promote themselves.

---
## Term & Commitment

Appointment is non-fixed, aligned with the 4-year AA cycle.

Service is voluntary, symbolic, and intellectual rather than operational.

A NED may step down at any time without explanation.



---

## Ideal NED Profile

Trusted, independent thinker.

Comfortable operating in ambiguity and constraint.

Understands that AA is not a company pretending to be art, but art using the company form.



---

## Function in the System

If the Director is the King,
the NEDs are the Council.

If the shareholders are the Chosen,
the NEDs are the Witnesses.

Together, they ensure AA remains coherent, rare, and resistant to decay.

---

## NEXT STEPS 

Integrate old version into new version above.
