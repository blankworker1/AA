# Director - AA Ltd


## Legal & Corporate Responsibilities

Acts as the legally responsible officer for AA Ltd.

Maintains statutory registers and ensures all filings with Companies House are accurate and timely.

Manages corporate assets, both physical (artifacts, COAs, share certificates) and digital (Bitcoin, IPFS records, domains).

Ensures the company complies with all corporate governance and legal obligations.


## Operational & Strategic Duties

Oversees day-to-day operations of the AA system, including issuance of shares, certificates, and artifact verification.

Coordinates with Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) to report and advise on areas of expertise.

Maintains oversight of digital systems, dashboards, and Lightning payment interactions.


## Artistic & Conceptual Interface

Serves as the human interface of the artwork, embodying the tension between legal formality and artistic ritual.

Facilitates the ritualized interaction between collectors, The Chosen, and the wider public.

Upholds the AA ethos: rarity, participation, stacked provenance, and consent-driven engagement.


## Public Representation & Confidentiality

Represents AA in any necessary communications but minimizes personal exposure; maintains anonymity where possible.

Ensures that the mystique and ritual of the project remain intact while providing necessary transparency for legal and operational purposes.


## Ideal Candidate Attributes

Comfortable navigating legal, operational, and artistic domains simultaneously.

Understands hybrid value systems, combining physical, digital, and social participation.

Patient, disciplined, and attuned to conceptual frameworks, capable of maintaining the “performance” aspect of AA in public and private interactions.


## Key Outcome:

AA Ltd functions both as a legally compliant entity and as a living artwork. The Director ensures that law, corporate structure, and ritual coexist seamlessly, preserving the project’s conceptual integrity while enabling collector participation and provenance.

If you like, I can also draft a similarly styled role description for the NEDs, showing how they act as a privy council/advisory layer within the artwork. Do you want me to do that next?
