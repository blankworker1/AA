# AA ROI (Return on Investment) – Definition

## 1. Concept

 Definition - “AA ROI” shall mean the measurable benefit or value derived by a Shareholder upon the retirement or conversion of a Share, expressed through the collectible and market value of the physical certificate formerly evidencing that Share.


## 2. Conversion and Certificate Retirement


Upon the conversion of a Share from one class to another (including, without limitation, A4 → C4 or C4 → R4), the Shareholding shall be converted in accordance with these Articles and recorded in the register of members.

Upon such conversion, the original physical share certificate shall be deemed retired and legally inert, and shall cease to evidence any legal, voting, or economic rights in the Company.

The physical certificate shall not be required to be returned to the Company.


## 3. Letter of Endorsement


Following conversion, the Company shall issue a Letter of Endorsement confirming:
(a) the conversion of the Share,
(b) the retirement and legal inertness of the original physical certificate, and
(c) the continuation of the Shareholding in the new Share class.

The Letter of Endorsement shall be digitally recorded and published to a decentralized content-addressed storage system (including IPFS) in the same manner as a certificate of authenticity.

A reference or access link to the Letter of Endorsement shall be communicated to the Shareholder by electronic means, including via a Lightning message or equivalent cryptographically verifiable notification.


## 4. Emergence of AA ROI



Upon issuance of the Letter of Endorsement, the retired physical certificate may be sold, auctioned, or otherwise transferred as a collectible limited edition.

Any value realized from such sale or transfer shall constitute the Shareholder’s AA ROI, determined solely by market demand and reflecting scarcity, provenance, edition number, historical lineage, and cultural significance, rather than any rights formerly attached to the underlying Share.


## 5. Calculation and Recognition



The Company shall not fix, guarantee, or underwrite AA ROI, which is inherently market-determined and independent of the Company’s financial performance or distributions.

Any realization of value from a retired certificate shall be separate from and shall not affect the rights, obligations, or status of the Shareholder in respect of the converted Share.


## 6. Scope



This definition applies to all Share classes (including A4, C4, and R4) and any successor or additional classes created pursuant to these Articles.

AA ROI is intentionally emergent and subjective, reflecting the separation of the Share as a legal instrument from the certificate as a collectible artifact.
