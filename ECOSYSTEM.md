# AA Ecosystem



## 1. The Chosen: Shareholders

The 21 shareholders are legally and conceptually sovereign.

They choose to participate; their selection is voluntary, deliberate, and performative.

Each share certificate is both a legal artifact and an artwork, a tangible embodiment of their decision.

They are custodians and co-authors of the ongoing narrative of AA.

## 2. The King: Director

Acts as the visible mediator between law, assets, and narrative.

Performs ritualistic and operational duties while maintaining the mystique of the project.

Interfaces with galleries, collectors, and tippers.



---

## 3. The Privy Council: NEDs

Specialist advisors who protect, guide, and maintain the conceptual and operational integrity of the company/artwork.

Each NED represents a domain of expertise, forming a mythical advisory body in the narrative.

Their function is both real (advisory/legal/technical) and symbolic (artistic/performative).



---

## 4. The Public / Participants / Tippers

Visitors, collectors, and participants of gallery experiences, particularly those interacting via the Tip the Art mechanism.

They are the audience and the fuel of AA — their attention, engagement, and micro-payments create resonance and value.

Through their actions, they are co-creators of the digital ecosystem, contributing to the hybrid artwork’s evolution.

Their participation extends the art beyond the legal boundaries, making AA a living, participatory system.

## 5. Conceptual Dynamics

Shareholders (Chosen) → sovereign core, legal and mythic power.

Director (King) → visible authority, bridges legality and performance.

NEDs (Privy Council) → advisory, guardians, performers.

Public / Tippers → emergent creators, audience, and catalysts of attention and value.



---

## 6. Implications

The ecosystem is multi-layered, blending legal authority, artistic narrative, and public participation.

Value is co-created: shareholders provide ownership legitimacy, tippers provide engagement, and the director/NEDs orchestrate.

Future growth of AA depends on expanding participation without diluting the conceptual integrity.
