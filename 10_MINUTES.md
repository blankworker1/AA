## 0. SPACE & SET (Before audience enters)

A single wall holds 10 identical blank canvases, evenly spaced in a straight horizontal line.

No markings. No numbers.

Beneath each canvas is an empty space for a title placard.

A large, round table sits centrally in the room.

Clearly labeled: POOL

Covered with:

Plain paper

Post-it notes

Pens and simple markers



A digital screen is mounted visibly:

Displays a timechain clock (see image above)

Counts down fixed 10-minute intervals

No text. Only time.


Subtle ambient audio is already present:

Low, continuous

Non-melodic

Suggests pressure without urgency


Cameras are positioned:

One wide shot of the wall

One focused on the active canvas

One overhead or angled shot of the POOL


The live stream begins before the audience enters.


Artists are present, visible, inactive.


---

## 1. AUDIENCE ARRIVAL / MEMPOOL FORMATION (0:00–10:00)

The clock is already running.

Audience enters the space to find:

Blank canvases

The clock counting down

The POOL table waiting


No verbal instructions.

A small sign near the POOL reads:

> Draw. Write. Mark.

Place your work in the POOL.



Audience members begin creating:

Sketches

Symbols

Words

Abstract marks


These papers accumulate openly in the POOL.

The live stream shows this clearly. The room fills slowly with quiet activity.


---

## 2. BLOCK 1 — MINING BEGINS (10:00)

When the clock flips:

A low, definitive audio tone sounds.

Artist 1 steps forward immediately.

They select the first canvas on the left.

Painting begins at once.

No announcement.

No introduction.

The act itself establishes permission.


---

## 3. DURING EACH BLOCK (REPEATED STRUCTURE)

**A. ARTIST ACTION (Proof of Work)**

The artist paints continuously for the full 10 minutes.

The act of painting is the proof of work.

The artist may:

Select images from the POOL

Tear, layer, collage, obscure, or transform them


Selection is subjective and visible.

Nothing is erased.

Nothing pauses the clock.


**B. AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION (Transactions)**

Audience members continue contributing to the POOL.

They observe which pieces are included.

Rejected contributions remain visible, waiting.

Some contributions will never be included.


No explanation is given. Understanding emerges through observation.

**C. LIGHTNING PARTICIPATION (Tip the Art)**

Each active canvas has a visible Lightning QR code nearby:

“Tip the Art”

Tips may influence nothing.

Or they may influence selection.

The rules are intentionally opaque.


The audience learns by watching outcomes.


---

**4. AUDIO DESIGN (Time Pressure)**

Background sound evolves within each block:

Minimal at the start

Slightly denser toward the end


As the clock approaches zero:

A subtle tension emerges


Never rhythmic.

Never distracting.

Time remains dominant.



---

**5. BLOCK FINALITY (Every 10 Minutes)**

When the clock reaches zero:

All background audio cuts instantly.

A single confirmation sound plays.

The artist stops immediately—mid-gesture if necessary.


An assistant enters:

Places a placard beneath the canvas:

Block [number]


Photographs the canvas exactly as it stands.

Uploads the image to IPFS.

The IPFS hash may briefly appear on the live stream.



The canvas is now immutable.


---

**6. TRANSITION (30–60 seconds)**

The next artist steps forward.

The previous artist steps back.

No applause is prompted.

The clock begins the next interval.


The chain continues.


---

**7. MIDPOINT SHIFT (After Block 5)**

Without announcement:

The room is quieter.

Fewer people draw.

More people watch the clock.


The audience now understands the rules without having been taught them.


---

**8. FINAL BLOCK (Block 10)**

The final artist paints knowing:

There is no next block.


Contributions continue to enter the POOL.

None will be included.


When the clock hits zero:

The confirmation sound lasts longer.

Then silence.


The clock stops.


---

**9. END STATE**

Ten canvases remain on the wall.

Sequentially labeled:

Block 1 → Block 10

The POOL table remains full of unused transactions.

The live stream continues for several minutes in silence.


No closing remarks.
No explanation.

Near the exit, one final line:

> The work is complete.

This is the script. The score.
