#Infographic

Prompt — AA Ltd Infographic

Create a minimalist, high-contrast infographic illustrating the ecosystem of AA Ltd (Anonymous Art). The layout should be clear, conceptual, and suitable for gallery display.

Key elements:

1. Shareholders (21, “The Chosen”) – apex of authority; geometric shapes numbered 1–21.


2. Director (“The King”) – central figure bridging law, assets, and narrative.


3. NEDs (Privy Council) – six advisors around the Director: Legal/IP, Compliance, Tax, Technical, Curatorial, Communications.


4. Public / Tippers – periphery; represent gallery visitors and participants.



Connections:

Shareholders → Director (legal authority)

Director → NEDs (guidance)

Public ↔ Artworks (participation, engagement)


Design:

Clean, geometric, conceptual, black/white with subtle accents

Portrait or square layout

Labels for each layer only; no logos or decorative UI


Goal: Show hierarchy, interaction, and flow of authority and participation as a living, conceptual artwork.
