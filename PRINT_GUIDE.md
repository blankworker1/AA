PHYSICAL PROSPECTUS AS ARTWORK

The Prospectus package consists of three elements, inseparable by design:

1. The Printed Prospectus (21 pages)

Spiral-bound (metal, black)

Individually numbered (1–21)

No reprints

No public edition


This is not “marketing material.”
It is a limited physical artwork that also functions as a legal disclosure.


---

2. Certificate of Authenticity (Loose, A4 or A5)

Included as a separate sheet, not bound.

Purpose

Confirms the Prospectus itself is an AA artwork

Establishes edition number and authenticity

Mirrors the language of the artworks (BALANCE, GOLD)


Design

White or off-white paper

Black text only

AA logo + strapline

No signatures except AA (stylised, not a person)


Suggested Text

> This document certifies that the accompanying Prospectus is an original, limited-edition artwork issued by Anonymous Art Ltd.

Edition: ___ of 21

This Prospectus forms part of the Anonymous Art system and may not be reproduced.

Ownership of this object does not imply ownership of the ideas it contains.

AA



This certificate is itself uploadable to IPFS and referenced by the NFC tag.


---

3. NFC Tag (Affixed to Prospectus)

Discreet round white NTAG424 sticker

Placed on the inside back cover or rear page

Not visually promoted


When scanned:

Resolves to a permanent IPFS-hosted asset

Displays:

Digital version of the Prospectus (watermarked)

Certificate of Authenticity image

Edition number verification

Statement of provenance



The tag does not “unlock content.”
It confirms reality.


---

WHY THIS WORKS (IMPORTANT)

Everything is Art

Prospectus = artwork

Certificate = artwork

NFC interaction = artwork

Share certificate = artwork


Nothing is “supporting material.”


---

Legal + Conceptual Alignment

The Prospectus fulfills disclosure requirements

The certificate fulfills artistic provenance

The NFC fulfills permanence and verification


Each system reinforces the others without conflict.


---

Scarcity Is Structural

Only 21 printed Prospectuses exist

Only recipients receive them

Even non-shareholders who receive one hold a rare object


This allows secondary value to emerge naturally.


---

Collectors Understand This Instantly

To the right audience:

This feels closer to a passport than a brochure

More archive than advertisement

More artifact than pitch



---

ONE OPTIONAL BUT POWERFUL DETAIL

Number every element consistently:

Prospectus: Edition 07/21

Certificate: Edition 07/21

Share Certificate (if issued): Share 07/21


This creates a stacked provenance.


---

Final Framing Thought

By doing this, AA is saying:

> We do not document art.
We operationalise it.
