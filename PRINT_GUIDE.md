# PRINT GUIDE

Recommended Physical Prospectus Specification

## 1. Format / Size

A4 Portrait (210 × 297 mm) — strongly recommended

Why:

Feels legal / governmental / corporate

Matches Articles, Memorandum, share registers

Signals seriousness, not marketing

Easy to archive, store, and reference


Avoid:

Square formats (too art-book)

A5 (too casual)

Oversized formats (too exhibition-like)


This is a document, not a coffee-table book.


---

## 2. Binding

Black metal spiral binding (wire-o / spirale metallica)

Why:

Functional, not decorative

Allows the document to lie flat (important)

Signals “working document” + “manual”

Slightly industrial → fits law-as-medium


Avoid white or silver spiral.
Black only.


---

## 3. Cover

Cardstock, not hardback

Matte finish

Black or off-white cover

Minimal text only:

ANONYMOUS ART LTD

PROSPECTUS

Private circulation



No images. No texture tricks.


---

## 4. Paper Stock (Interior)

170 gsm uncoated / matte (or 150 gsm if you want more flexibility)

Why:

Feels substantial

No glare

Ink sits flat

Feels like legislation, not lifestyle


Avoid:

Glossy paper

Very thin stock (cheap)

Recycled paper that looks “eco-branded”


This is about permanence, not virtue signalling.


---

## 5. Colour

Black & white only

No greyscale gradients

No accent colours

Diagrams in pure black lines


This reinforces:

Authority

Timelessness

Reproducibility



---

## 6. Typography

(You don’t need to specify to Pixart, but for design consistency)

Serif or institutional sans (e.g. Garamond / Times / Inter / Source Serif)

Generous margins

Comfortable line spacing

Page numbers at bottom centre or bottom right


Think: legal brief, not manifesto.


---

## 7. Number of Pages

21 pages - numbers matter

Signals seriousness

Avoids pitch-deck feel


Example breakdown:

Cover: 1

Notice to Reader: 1

Executive Summary: 1

Vision: 2

Ecosystem: 2

Offering: 2

Share Certificate: 2

Governance: 3

Assets & Custody: 2

Risks: 2

Eligibility & Signalling Interest: 1

Total 21 pages



---

## 8. Print Run

Very small. Intentionally so.

Suggestions:

25 copies total ( to allow for damaged / defective copies)

21 potential recipients

3 archive

3 director/council

3 contingency



Each copy:

Individually numbered

Possibly hand-signed “AA”

No reprints unless formally declared



---

## 9. Finishing Touch

Number stamped or handwritten on inside cover:

Copy 07 / 30


No barcodes

No ISBN

No copyright page


This is not a book.
It is a bounded artifact.


---

## 10. Relationship to Digital Version

Digital PDF is identical in layout

Physical version carries weight and ritual

Digital version carries reach and permanence


Neither is primary.
They coexist.


---

## Summary Recommendation (TL;DR)

Size: A4 Portrait

Binding: Black metal spiral

Paper: 170 gsm matte, black & white

Pages: 21

Print run: 25 copies

Tone: Legal, sovereign, calm


This will read as:

> “This exists whether you participate or not.”



If you want next, we should:

Lock the cover typography

Or draft the Notice to the Reader exactly as it will be printed

Or decide how copies are physically delivered (this matters)


Each choice compounds meaning.

---

## PHYSICAL PROSPECTUS AS ARTWORK

The Prospectus package consists of three elements, inseparable by design:

## 1. The Printed Prospectus (21 pages)

Spiral-bound (metal, black)

Individually numbered (1–21)

No reprints

No public edition


This is not “marketing material.”
It is a limited physical artwork that also functions as a legal disclosure.


---

## 2. Certificate of Authenticity (Loose, A4 or A5)

Included as a separate sheet, not bound.

Purpose

Confirms the Prospectus itself is an AA artwork

Establishes edition number and authenticity

Mirrors the language of the artworks (BALANCE, GOLD)


Design

White or off-white paper

Black text only

AA logo + strapline

No signatures except AA (stylised, not a person)

Suggested Text:

````

This document certifies that [Prospectus] is an original, limited-edition artwork issued by Anonymous Art Ltd.

Edition: __ of 21

Tag ID: [14 character NFC tag unique id]

[Prospectus] forms part of the Anonymous Art system and may not be reproduced.

Ownership of this object does not imply ownership of the ideas it contains.

AA

````

This certificate is itself uploadable to IPFS and referenced by the NFC tag.


---

## 3. NFC Tag (Affixed to Prospectus)

Discreet round white NTAG424 sticker

Placed on the inside back cover or rear page

Not visually promoted


When scanned:

Resolves to a permanent IPFS-hosted asset

Displays:

Digital version of the Prospectus (watermarked)

Certificate of Authenticity image

Edition number verification

Statement of provenance



The tag does not “unlock content.”
It confirms reality.


---

## WHY THIS WORKS (IMPORTANT)

Everything is Art

Prospectus = artwork

Certificate = artwork

NFC interaction = artwork

Share certificate = artwork


Nothing is “supporting material.”


---

Legal + Conceptual Alignment

The Prospectus fulfills disclosure requirements

The certificate fulfills artistic provenance

The NFC fulfills permanence and verification


Each system reinforces the others without conflict.


---

Scarcity Is Structural

Only 21 printed Prospectuses exist

Only recipients receive them

Even non-shareholders who receive one hold a rare object


This allows secondary value to emerge naturally.


---

Collectors Understand This Instantly

To the right audience:

This feels closer to a passport than a brochure

More archive than advertisement

More artifact than pitch



---

## ONE POWERFUL DETAIL

Number every element consistently:

Prospectus: Edition 07/21

Certificate: Edition 07/21

Share Certificate (if issued): Share 07/21


This creates a stacked provenance.


---

Final Framing Thought

By doing this, AA is saying:

We do not document art. We operationalise it
