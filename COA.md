# AA Certificate of Authenticity (COA)

## 1. Nature and Purpose
   
A Certificate of Authenticity (“COA”) is a document issued by the Company for evidentiary and provenance purposes only, confirming the authenticity, origin, and status of a physical share certificate or retired share certificate artwork. A COA does not constitute, create, transfer, or evidence any legal, equitable, voting, or economic interest in the Company.


# 2. Relationship to Shareholding

The existence, absence, or transfer of a COA shall have no effect on the ownership of Shares, which shall be determined exclusively by entries in the register of members maintained by the Company in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. A COA may reference a Share or former Share solely for identification and historical record.


## 3. Issuance and Form

The Company may issue a COA in physical or digital form, including by recording or publishing it on a decentralized or content-addressed system, and may communicate access or verification details electronically. The form, medium, and method of publication of a COA shall be determined by the Company from time to time and shall not affect its evidentiary purpose.


# 4. Legal Effect

A COA serves only as confirmation of provenance, authenticity, and historical status of a certificate or artwork and shall not be relied upon as proof of current share ownership, entitlement to dividends, voting rights, or any other rights associated with Shares in the Company.


# 5. Transfer and Collectibility
   
A COA may be transferred together with or separately from a physical certificate or artwork and may be used to support the collectible or archival value of such item. Any transfer or valuation of a COA or related certificate shall be entirely independent of the legal rights attached to any Share.
