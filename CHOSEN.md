# The Chosen


The Chosen are sovereign individuals who understand what it means to decide.

They recognise that freedom is not granted, but exercised. Each has understood the vision and aims of Anonymous Art and has made a conscious choice to participate.

They are collectors of assets.

Art is an asset.

Bitcoin is an asset.

Shares are an asset.

A limited-edition physical share certificate, legally recognised, partly paid in Bitcoin, is an apex asset that combines:

ownership

scarcity

legal force

belief


To hold one is not to speculate, but to belong.

Ownership functions like a passport - quiet proof of participation in a system that operates on different rails.

The Chosen do not seek attention. They do not perform. They hold.

## Who are the Chosen?

The chosen are not chosen, they choose for themselves

We should approach profiling for an artwork, not as marketing or financial solicitation. The prospectus is itself a conceptual object. Who receives it is part of the work.

Here is a clear, grounded profile of who the Chosen are, and just as importantly, who they are not.


## Who the Prospectus Is For

1. Sovereign Collectors

These are people who already think in terms of ownership, custody, and self-direction.

Comfortable holding assets directly

Understand the difference between possession and control

Not dependent on institutions to validate value


They don’t ask “Is this allowed?”
They ask “Does this make sense?”



2. Asset-Literate, Not Speculative

The Chosen are not chasing upside.

They understand:

Art as an asset class

Bitcoin as an asset, not a trade

Shares as instruments of governance, not leverage


They are comfortable with:

Illiquidity

Long time horizons

Assets that cannot be easily priced


If they ask “What’s the exit plan?” — they are not Chosen.


3. Culturally Bilingual

They can move between worlds without explanation:

Art ↔ finance

Law ↔ culture

Physical ↔ digital


They understand that:

A legal document can be an artwork

A company can be a sculpture

A share certificate can be more meaningful than a token


They don’t need metaphors explained.


4. Low-Signal, High-Agency Individuals

The Chosen are rarely loud.

Not obsessed with public profiles

Not building personal brands

Comfortable operating privately


They recognise that true power does not announce itself.


5. Already Inside the System — or Already Outside It

Two acceptable archetypes:

A. Inside, but disillusioned

Senior figures in art, finance, law, or technology

Understand the system’s limits from within


B. Outside, by design

Independent thinkers

Builders, collectors, or patrons who opted out early


Both understand that new structures must be built, not protested.


---

## Who the Prospectus Is NOT For

Retail investors

Speculators

Influencers

Grant-seekers

People asking for permission

People who need reassurance


If they need convincing, they are not Chosen.


---

## How the Physical Prospectus Is Sent

Direct, private delivery

No public application

No pitch deck

No deadline pressure


Receiving the prospectus is not an offer.
It is an invitation to decide.

Silence is a valid response.
Declining is respected.

Choosing is the act.


---

## Final Framing

The prospectus is not about selling shares.

It is about identifying:

> people who already live as if this structure should exist.


Those who recognise it will recognise themselves.
